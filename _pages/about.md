Currently, I am a PhD candidate in the Machine Learning / Intelligent Data Analysis group at TU Berlin, working with [Prof. Dr. Klaus-Robert Müller](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jplQac8AAAAJ&hl=en).

Prior to starting my PhD, I completed my Master's in Computer Science at TU Berlin. I did my Master's thesis in the Explainable AI field under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Klaus-Robert Müller](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jplQac8AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Dr. Jürgen Gall](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1CLaPMEAAAAJ).
