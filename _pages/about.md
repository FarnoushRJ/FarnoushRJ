I am a doctoral researcher in the Machine Learning / Intelligent Data analysis group at Technische Universität Berlin, working with [Prof. Dr. Klaus-Robert Müller](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jplQac8AAAAJ&hl=en). Before embarking on my Ph.D. journey, I accomplished my M.Sc. in Computer Science at TU Berlin in the year 2021. My primary focus lies in enhancing the transparency and efficiency of machine learning models.
